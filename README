Please Download assets 1 and 2, and combine all the files in both folders into one file named "assets". 

Make sure that the "CEP Final.py" is run in a similar folder as "assets". 

Do note that the bot you are playing against will not attack you as the AI portion of the code is not yet complete. The game can be recoded into a Player Versus Player game 
where two players play against each other using the same keyboard.
